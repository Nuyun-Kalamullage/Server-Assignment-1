Once the server is established, you should be able to connect to the server using a common communication tool such as nc or telnet.

ex :-
If you are using windows you have to run the server and type "telnet localhost 2021" for the Client-Server side and type "telnet localhost 2022" for the Publisher-Subscriber side. Note that you have to install telnet command in windows.
Further, If you have a unix system you have to type Commands with replacing "telnet" using "nc".
